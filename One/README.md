# One

> Simple BIOS-interrupt echo bootloader

*One* is not an **Operative System**, is a *bootloader* that echoes back all
the keyboard input using the **BIOS** interrupts.

## Bootloader

The *One* **bootleader** is the simpliest, it prints a message and waits for
another message to echo back this message. All this is done using the **BIOS**
interrupts vectors.
