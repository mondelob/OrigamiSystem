ORSH as it names says is a shell for the *OrigamiSystem*. It's a simple shell
that implements common functions, such a process execution or built-in
functions.

Actually ORSH only have three built-in functions:

* cd (Change directory)
* help

**ORSH** needs more work to be completly functional. Things that actually ORSH
needs are:

* Pipelines
* STDOUT and STDERR redirection
